  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/mountain_panorama.jpg" alt="Mynydd Marchywel">
  <h2>Mynydd Marchywel (1,371 feet)</h2>
  <p>The mountain upon which the farm cottages sit, Mynydd Marchywel (Hywel's Stallion), is one of a series of stepped escarpments that rise to heights of over a 1,000 feet across the region, giving the South Wales landscape its areas of wild, barren moorland. The summit of the mountain is marked by three prehistoric funerary and ritual stone circles.</p>

<div id="upper-boundary" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/upper-boundary.jpg" alt="The Upper Boudary of Plas Farm">
  <h2>The Upper Boundary</h2>
  <p>The upper boundary of the farm is a great spot to see birds, where the farmland meets the barren mountainous moorland.  Look out for charms of goldfinches flittering amongst the thistle heads, buzzards soaring over the mountain on thermals, stonechats sitting on the fence ‘tchacking’ away, skylarks singing their chirruping song, linnets, wheatears and lots of meadow pipits.</p>
</div>

  <h2>Sheep Grazed Woodland</h2>
  <p>This picture was taken on The Plas Farm Trail. You can spot the way-marker on the fence post and a stile between the trees in the distance. It is a magical part of the trail and a lovely place to stop for a picnic. The trees are mainly silver birch and willow. Carpets of unusual mosses join the trees and small native bluebells sprout through the green grazed grass.</p>

<div id="valley-views" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/4599-landscape-100906.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Valley Views</h2>
  <p>This September landscape was taken from the sheltered slopes behind the holiday cottages.  The foreground is dominated by striking mountain ash trees, laden with red berries. In the middle distance, Welsh mountain sheep graze on grassy slopes and in the far distance, the dramatic ice-carved western side of the Swansea Valley is coloured shades of yellow by the autumn sun. This barren rocky mountain is Allt-y-grug, which translates as The Hillside of Heather.</p>
</div>

<div id="clawdd" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/147-hedge-170507.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Historic Field Boundary</h2>
  <p>A characteristic feature of the Welsh landscape - an earth bank faced with vertical stones, or clawdd, upon which sits a modern stock proof barbed wire fence. In Wales, most field boundaries are less than 200 years old, making them a relatively new addition to the landscape.  Very often a clawdd will have (or will have had) a hedge on top of it.  It is likely that the three hawthorns and silver birch in the picture are the remains of an old hedge. The earth core can be a haven for small mammals – more so than a dry stone wall.  Something in excess of 80% of all the recorded flowering plant species in Wales have been found on cloddiau (plural of clawdd).</p>
  <p>The clawdd is most common in cattle areas where there is less need for height in terms of stock proofing. If additional stock proofing was required dead wood or gorse would have been piled on top of the structure.  Luckily for our generation, in 1867, Lucien B. Smith of Kent, Ohio developed the first wire technology capable of restraining cattle.  He had invented barbed wire.  In 1874, a Wild West farmer called Joseph Glidden improved his design and started to produce barbed wire in the form we recognize today. Over a century later and we still haven’t bettered his idea.</p>

<div id="mountain-ash" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/mountain-ash.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Mountain Ash</h2>
  <p>The upper fields of Plas Farm are have wonderful views of the surrounding countryside. You will start to notice mountain trees amongst the oaks that border the fields.  Look out for the beautiful red berried rowan (or mountain ash), crab apples and you will even pass a wild damson tree.</p>
</div>

<div id="cwm-tawe" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/616263a-panorama-140706.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Cwm Tawe View</h2>
  <p>Plas Farm enjoys superb views of the world famous Swansea Valley - in Welsh, Cwm Tawe - which stretches from the Brecon Beacons in the north to the seaside city of Swansea in the South.  It was shaped by glacial action millenia ago and has seen great changes through the rise and fall of the iron and
coal industries over the past 200 years, as one of the main cradles of the industrial revolution.  The Swansea Valley was to industry what the Silicon Valley is to IT today.  From this point you will be able to pick out landmarks such as the largest building on the horizon - the UK's Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency. You will also enjoy views of Pontardawe - the spire of St Peter's and the Golf Club high on the hill that overlooks the town. </p>

<div id="cattle" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/124-cows-170507.jpg" alt="Beef cattle grazing at Plas Farm in South Wales">
  <h2>Beef Cattle Grazing in Early Summer</h2>
  <p>Beef cattle of varying breeds may be seen grazing Plas Farm including Welsh Black, Hereford, Charolais and Limousin.  May is a good month to spot some cute calves. A beef cow is dry all winter, calves in the spring and rears its offspring over the summer months.</p>
</div>

<div id="rush-pasture" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/rush-pasture.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Rush Pasture</h2>
  <p>This sheltered rush pasture is a splendid place to spot wildlife. Listen for delights such as the grasshopper warbler and the reed bunting who like to nest here.  Wild flowers like tormentil and devil's bit scabious grow here with the odd solitary foxglove towering above the rushes. This is also a great place to spot butterflies - look for orange tips on the milk flowers as well as ringlets and small skippers near the margins where tadpoles can be seen every spring.</p>
</div>

<div id="back-fields" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/back-fields.jpg" alt="">
  <h2>Back Fields</h2>
  <p>The "back fields" at Plas Farm are a series of three sheltered grassy fields that run uphill from the farmyard, linking the flat parkland areas in front of the cottages to the rush pasture and open hillside areas behind the cottages where one can enjoy panoramic views of the Swansea Valley, Swansea Bay, the Bristol Channel and England beyond, Brecon Beacons National Park and on a clear day, Narnia..</p>
</div>

<div id="bluebells" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/bluebell-woodland.jpg" alt="Bluebell Woodland">
  <h2>Bluebell Woodland</h2>
  <p>The UK is home to half of the world's population of bluebells and you'll be pleased to know we have lots of them at Plas Farm. The Welsh name Clychau's Gog translates as Cuckoo Bells since they flower around the same time the cuckoo is first heard in springtime. Our cottages come with their own private bluebell woodland and in case you were wondering, cuckoos have holidayed with us for as long as anyone can remember. They're very naughty and sometimes push residents out of their beds.</p>
</div>

<div id="hideout" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/bunker.jpg" alt="hideout">
  <h2>World War Two British Resistance Hideout</h2>
  <p>Will you be able to find our secret underground hide-out? Located near a path that runs through our bluebell woodland, it was built by the British Resistance Movement during World War II, the world’s first resistance organization ever to be established in advance of an invasion, and widely regarded as the forerunners of today’s SAS.</p>
<p>At this time, an invasion of Britain was considered imminent so Churchill ordered that small teams of local men who know their countryside intimately were recruited secretly from the Home Guard and given specialist training in sabotage and guerrilla warfare.  The Units were organised in patrols of between four and eight men, with each patrol having a specially constructed Operational Base (also called a hide or hide-out), usually hidden in woodland.  The hideout at Plas Farm is one of very few to have survived in Britain and is listed by the government as a Scheduled Ancient Monument in recognition of its national importance as a significant relic from the Second World War. </p>

<div id="lucombe-oak" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/lucombe-oak.jpg" alt="lucombe oak">
  <h2>Lucombe Oak</h2>
  <p>Keeping watch over farmyard activities, this large uncommon tree, a hybrid of Turkey Oak and Cork Oak, was first noted by William Lucombe, an Exeter nurseryman, in the 1760s. It has mossy acorn cups and pointy lobes on its leaves like the Turkey Oak and keeps its leaves throughout the winter until just before new growth appears, like its other parent, the Cork Oak.   Legend has it that Lucombe was so impressed with the timber that he that he felled his original tree in 1785 and kept planks of it under his bed to make a coffin.  By the time he died at the age of 102, his timber had rotted beyond use so another tree was felled and used instead.</p>
</div>

<div id="back-road" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/back-road.jpg" alt="back road">
  <h2>Back Road</h2>
  <p>The back road is a long winding country lane that helps to complete a circular walk from the holiday cottage doorstep, up the hill to the top of Plas Farm and back down to the cottages via the crossroads in the hamlet of Cilybebyll.  Enjoy wonderful views of the river valley over the mossy stone wall.  In late Spring you'll see spectacular varieties of rhododendron, imported exotics planted by the Victorian gentry as an expression of wealth, social prominence and extravagant lifestyle.  The deep shades of red, varying hues of mauve, pink and white are a sight to behold.</p>
</div>

<div id="grazed-oak-woodland" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/grazed-oak-woodland.jpg" alt="grazed oak woodland">
  <h2>Grazed Oak Woodland</h2>
  <p>A beautiful place for a summer picnic. Sit among the majestic oak trees and watch the wildlife. Enjoy the birdsong and the tinkling of a small mountain stream runs as it runs down the hillside to join the River Clydach near the holiday cottages.</p>
</div>

<div id="coin" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/coin_plas_farm.jpg" alt="coin">
  <h2>1578 Queen Elizabeth I Sixpence</h2>
  <p>The coin found here was minted when Shakespeare was a teenager, Sir Francis Drake was circumnavigating the globe and Plas Farm had yet to see a potato. The population of Britain was just over 4 million (compared to over 64 million today) and the flush toilet had not yet been invented.</p>
</div>

<div id="weir" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/5108-weir-091006.jpg" alt="weir">
  <h2>The Weir</h2>
  <p> Plas Farm's spectacular weir was used to raise the level of the River Clydach such that water could be run in a wooden tar-lined trough along the back of what is now Y Stabl and Ty Cerbyd holiday cottages (you can still see some of the tar on the walls) and onto an overshot waterwheel that was part of Bwthyn Y Saer holiday cottage. It was used to power machines including a turnip pulper that was located in what is now the master bedroom in Bwthyn Y Saer.</p>

<div id="river" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/river-cottages.jpg" alt="river">
  <h2>The River Clydach</h2>
  <p>The holiday cottages sit on the bank of the picturesque River Clydach where wildlife flourishes. See wild trout leaping from the crystal clear waters, the disappearing act of a dipper, or a grey wagtail hopping from stone to stone.  There are also visits from the heron and if you're very lucky you may even see an otter passing through.</p>

<div id="biomass" class="pin mfp-hide clearfix">
  <img src="<?php bloginfo('template_url'); ?>/img/photos/biomass.jpg" alt="biomass boiler">
  <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
  <p>Our eco-friendly holiday cottages get all their heat and hot water from one large biomass boiler that burns either FSC approved wood chips sourced from a local woodland or wood pellets which are made from the residue from saw mills.  Biomass is an attractive fossil-fuel alternative because it is a renewable resource that is more evenly distributed over the Earth’s surface than finite fossil-fuel energy sources such as coal, oil and natural gas, and may be developed using more environmentally friendly technologies.</p>
